A python datapipeline project which builds on pydantic.

I have some new ideas how i want to evolve my datapipelines.
We will use the chance to use some modern python. Inspired by other great open source projects, e.g. fastapi.

## How to get started
In the process i will learn a lot.
Right now the big picture looks like this:

- Build Pydantic Data Models
- Use them for testing your DataPipeline
- Use Pydantic for the configs

- Build Datapipeline, i want to try out apache-airflow this time

- Bigquery we will use as datadump
- Load Data with minimum changes and mainly just don't damage data

- Use DBT for further transformations and reports
